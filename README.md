GMP stands for Gym Music Player

This is a Python Tkinter project for my phone gym that does not have internet access (as of this date). I decided to program a music player for a Raspberry Pi Touch screen that I will drill into the wall in my home gym. The music will play through a bluetooth speaker. 

All hardware and expenses were paid for by GRIPTAPE.ORG (Youth Driving Learning)
