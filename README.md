GMP stands for Gym Music Player

This is a Python Tkinter project for my phone gym that does not have internet access (as of this date). I decided to program a music player for a Raspberry Pi Touch screen that I will drill into the wall in my home gym. The music will play through a bluetooth speaker. 

All hardware and expenses were paid for by GRIPTAPE.ORG (Youth Driving Learning)

Prerequisites before downloading: 
1. Make sure there is a proper audio output on whatever you are downloading the program on (unknown "pulseaudio" software error (this is a critical error))
2. Make sure that docker is installed on whatever you are downloading the program on for downloading the tar file

Instructions on how to use:
1. Download the tar file... (adding tar file soon...)

Program is on pause for right now. Everything on the program works except for audio output on the Raspberry Pi due to "pulseaudio" error.
Currently too busy with College work to fix the error. Will fix and finish the project when on break.
